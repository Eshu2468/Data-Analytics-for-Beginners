======================================
3. insight generation and dash board creation?

insight generation : after cleaning data , you analyse to find all the hidden patterns and trends and relationship.
eg: "finding that sales increase during the festival 
season" ===> insight(observations)

steps for insight generations:
1. EDA (perform exploratory data analysis)
2. KPIs (revenue, profits, number of customers)
3. find correlation(does more advertisement lead to sales)
4. create a story around findings.

creation of dashboard?
1. understand the business requirement?
-> what does the user want to see?
    eg: monthly sales, top products)

2. sketch a layout
-before building in powerbi , draw it on papaer or tools like figma
-top --- KPI (totals sales , total orders)
-middle row --> trend charts(sales over time)
-bottom row --> top 5 products, regional sales

3. choose the rights visuals
-> line chart (for trends over time)
-> bar chart (comparison)
-> pie chart (proportions)
-> KPI cards (highlights numbers)

4. Build dashboard
- import data
-create visuals
-apply filters (time range, product category)

5. make it interactive:
- slicers
- drill-down options
- tooltip info

6. testing and feedback

---> create feedback and refine

7. publish / share:
=--> publish to power bi service , tableau servers or pdf report
