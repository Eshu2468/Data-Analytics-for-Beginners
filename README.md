## Data Types and Sources
* Types of Data:
* Structured Data: Organized in rows and columns (e.g., database tables).
* Unstructured Data: Text, images, videos, etc.
* 	Sources of Data:
* Internal Sources: Sales records, employee databases.
* External Sources: APIs, market research, social media feeds.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
•	Importance: Dirty or incomplete data can lead to incorrect insights.
•	Techniques:
o	Handling Missing Values: Replace with mean/median, or remove incomplete rows.
o	Dealing with Outliers: Remove or analyze separately.
o	Standardizing Data: Ensuring consistent formats (e.g., date, currency).
________________________________________
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Definition: The process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics.
•	Techniques:
o	Calculating mean, median, mode, standard deviation for numerical data.
o	Using correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables.
•	Tools: Excel’s pivot tables, Python’s pandas and matplotlib.
________________________________________
## Basic Data Visualizations
•	Charts and Their Uses:
o	Bar Chart: Compare categories (e.g., sales by region).
o	Pie Chart: Show proportions (e.g., market share).
o	Scatter Plot: Display relationships (e.g., age vs. income).
•	Tools: Excel, Power BI, Tableau, or Python libraries like seaborn.
________________________________________
## Data Analytics Tools
•	Overview of Popular Tools:
o	Excel: Easy-to-use for basic analysis.
o	Power BI/Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards.
o	SQL: For querying databases.
o	Python/R: Advanced analysis and automation.
•	Why These Tools Matter: Each tool has unique strengths for specific tasks.
________________________________________
## Case Study or Example
•	Dataset Example:
o	Scenario: Analyze a sales dataset.
o	Steps:
1.	Load the data (Excel/CSV).
2.	Clean the data (handle missing sales values).
3.	Create visualizations (e.g., total sales by region).
4.	Insights: Identify top-performing regions.
5. Show this process in a chosen tool (Excel, Power BI, Python).

# Types of Data Analytics

## 1. Descriptive Analytics
Purpose: Understand past and current data to describe "what happened."
•	Example: A sales report showing total revenue, the number of products sold, and customer distribution over the past year.
Tool: Excel or Power BI dashboard visualizing sales trends.
________________________________________
## 2. Diagnostic Analytics
Purpose: Investigate data to determine "why it happened."
•	Example: After identifying a dip in sales during a specific month, diagnostic analytics identifies the cause, such as a supply chain issue or a competitor's promotion.
Tool: SQL queries or data mining techniques to uncover patterns and correlations.
________________________________________
## 3. Predictive Analytics
Purpose: Use historical data to forecast "what is likely to happen."
•	Example: An e-commerce platform predicting future sales based on past trends, seasonal data, and customer behavior.
Tool: Machine learning models or Python libraries like scikit-learn for predictive modeling.
________________________________________
## 4. Prescriptive Analytics
Purpose: Recommend actions to optimize outcomes based on predictions.
•	Example: A logistics company using prescriptive analytics to decide the fastest and most cost-effective delivery routes considering traffic patterns and weather forecasts.
Tool: Optimization algorithms or advanced AI techniques in tools like IBM Decision Optimization.

________________________________________
## Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA)
•	Purpose: Explore data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, and test hypotheses without predefined objectives.
•	Example: Examining a dataset of customer transactions to discover hidden clusters or unexpected correlations.
•	Tools: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), R, Jupyter Notebooks.
________________________________________
## Inferential Analytics
•	Purpose: Draw conclusions about a population based on a sample dataset using statistical methods.
•	Example: Conducting a survey of 1,000 customers and inferring their satisfaction levels for a population of 1 million customers.
•	Techniques: Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, ANOVA.
________________________________________
## Cognitive Analytics
•	Purpose: Mimic human thought processes to interpret complex datasets using AI and machine learning.
•	Example: Virtual assistants like Siri analyzing user queries to provide context-aware responses.
•	Tools: Natural Language Processing (NLP), IBM Watson.
________________________________________
## Social Media Analytics
•	Purpose: Analyze data from social media platforms to understand trends, customer sentiment, and influence.
•	Example: Tracking the sentiment of tweets during a product launch to gauge customer reactions.
•	Tools: Tools like Hootsuite, Google Analytics, or APIs from social platforms.
________________________________________
## Text Analytics
•	Purpose: Extract meaningful insights from unstructured text data.
•	Example: Analyzing customer reviews to determine product sentiment or extracting keywords from documents.
•	Techniques: Text mining, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling using tools like NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob.
________________________________________
## Geospatial Analytics
•	Purpose: Analyze spatial data and visualize information in maps or geographic layouts.
•	Example: A logistics company using geospatial analytics to optimize delivery routes based on traffic and terrain.
•	Tools: GIS software like QGIS, Google Earth Engine, or Python libraries like geopandas.
________________________________________
## Real-Time Analytics
•	Purpose: Process and analyze data instantly as it is generated.
•	Example: Fraud detection systems in banking that flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
•	Tools: Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, AWS Kinesis.
________________________________________
## Customer Analytics
•	Purpose: Understand customer behavior, preferences, and lifetime value.
•	Example: Segmentation of customers into categories like loyal, at-risk, and inactive based on purchase history.
•	Tools: CRM software, advanced marketing analytics tools.
________________________________________
## Risk Analytics
•	Purpose: Identify and mitigate potential risks in business operations.
•	Example: Insurance companies analyzing historical claims data to predict high-risk policyholders.
•	Tools: Risk assessment models, SAS, or R.
________________________________________
## Supply Chain Analytics
